\CVItem{Fintech UI SDK}{
%   +----------------------------------+---------+
%   |               Topic              |  Answer |
%   +----------------------------------+---------+
%   | Challenges                       | Our Fintech UI's had no standard way of integration into client projects. Often UI's needed to be used together and we provided no mechanism to do this. Prior to this project we suggest clients build the combined UI's themselves based on bootstrap projects from the several UI's we do provide.        |
%   | Mistakes/Failures                |  Tried to consume react contexts with 
%                                          providers in different imported libraries       |
%   | Enjoyed                          |  The oppurtunity to design a major project in the company. Lerning about Monorepo design.       |
%   | Leadership                       | Assisted by a college graduate and helped plan out his tasks. Made sure he was on track and if he was facing any challenges.        |
%   | Conflicts                        | Figuring out how to implement a release cycle for UI's used in a single repo.        |
%   | What You'd Do Differently        | Instead of trying to use branches for releases per project (for safety purpose) instead we would use tags?        |
%   +----------------------------------+---------+
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eased multi-UI integration for clients by building merging functions for widgets and configurations which can be used independent or auto-merged in a single component.
	\item Simplified client projects by building a single scaffolding component which reduced UI projects down to a source file.
	\item Solved UI code duplication, discovery, testing and scaling issues by designing a lerna organized monorepo which all fintech teams now use.
